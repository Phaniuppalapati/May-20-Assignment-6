    "In Python, variables are created and used to store data values. To create variables in Python, you need to follow a few rules. Here are the key rules for creating variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore () character. They cannot start with a number or any other special character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After the first character, variable names can contain letters, numbers, or underscores. They are case-sensitive, meaning \"My Var\" and \"my var\" are considered different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to represent the data they hold. For example, \"name,\" \"age,\" or \"total_score\" are meaningful variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Python keywords (reserved words) cannot be used as variable names since they have special meanings in the language. Examples of keywords include \"if,\" \"for,\" \"while,\" \"def,\" and so on. You can find a list of Python keywords by running `help(\"keywords\") in a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Avoid using special characters like spaces, hyphens, dots, etc., within variable names. Underscores (_) can be used to separate multiple words within a variable name to enhance readability. For example\n",
    "\"my_variable\" is a valid variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It is good practice to follow the naming conventions for variables. Python convention recommends using lowercase letters and underscores for variable names (e.g., \"my_variable\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of valid variable names in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "name =\" exists ohn^ prime prime\n",
    "\n",
    "total\\ s core = 90.5\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Variable Names: Use lowercase letters for variable names. If a variable name consists of multiple words, separate them with underscores (\"snake_case\"). For example: \"my_variable', 'total_count`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q8.\n",
    "Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples\n",
    "In programming, mutable and immutable are two different characteristics of data types that determine whether their values can be changed after they are created. Let's explore each of these concepts in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types:\n",
    "Mutable data types are those whose values can be modified or changed after they are created. This means you can update, add, or remove elements from mutable objects without creating a new object. In other words, mutable objects are \"modifiable\" in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of mutable data types in many programming languages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists allow you to modify their elements by adding, removing, or replacing values at specific indexes.\n",
    "Dictionaries: Dictionaries enable you to modify the key-value pairs by adding, updating, or deleting elements.\n",
    "Sets: Sets can be modified by adding or removing elements.\n",
    "Arrays (depending on the programming language): In some programming languages, arrays are mutable and can have their elements changed.\n",
    "Here's an example in Python to illustrate the mutability of lists:\n",
    "# Creating a list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the list\n",
    "my_list[2] = 5\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding elements to the list\n",
    "my_list.append(6)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 4, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing elements from the list\n",
    "del my_list[0]\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [2, 5, 4, 6]\n",
    "Immutable Data Types:\n",
    "Immutable data types, on the other hand, are those whose values cannot be changed after they are created. This means you cannot modify the existing object; instead, you create a new object with the updated value. Immutable objects are \"unchangeable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of immutable data types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers (integers, floating-point numbers)\n",
    "Strings: Once a string is created, its value cannot be changed; you can only create new strings.\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. You cannot modify their elements after creation.\n",
    "Let's see an example in Python demonstrating the immutability of strings:\n",
    "# Creating a string\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the string (creating a new string)\n",
    "new_string = my_string.replace(\"world\")\n",
    "print(my_string)  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
    "print(new_string)  # Output: Hello, ChatGPT\n",
    "In the example above, the replace method creates a new string with the modified value, while the original string remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between mutable and immutable data types is important because it affects how you handle and manipulate data in a program. Immutable data types provide benefits such as immutability guarantees, improved performance, and ease of reasoning about the code, while mutable data types offer flexibility for modifying data in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.\n",
    "Sure! You can use a for loop to create the given structure. Here's an example code in Python:\n",
